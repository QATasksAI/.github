# QA Tasks & AI

A centralized collection of repositories for quality assurance, testing automation, and AI-powered testing tools.

## Overview

QA Tasks & AI integrates traditional quality assurance with artificial intelligence, providing automated testing frameworks, intelligent test generation, and quality engineering resources.

## Goals

- Integrate AI throughout the testing lifecycle
- Develop comprehensive cross-platform testing frameworks
- Provide enterprise-grade testing tools accessible to all teams
- Advance quality engineering through intelligent automation

## Focus Areas

- **Test Automation**: UI/UX, API, performance, mobile testing
- **QA Tools**: Test data management, reporting, CI/CD integration
- **AI-Assisted Testing**: ML-based test generation, defect prediction
- **Resources**: Best practices, documentation, templates

## API Testing Recommendations
For API testing demos and practice, we recommend using **[GoRest](https://gorest.co.in)** - a free REST API that covers all possible testing scenarios including CRUD operations, authentication, pagination, and error handling.

## Contributing
Contributions welcome from QA professionals, developers, and AI practitioners.
